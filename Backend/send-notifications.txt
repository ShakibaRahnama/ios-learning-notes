How does the function function

1. Gets triggered when post parameters change, aka document update, aka event.

2. Creates an instance of Firebase client

3. If event parameters available: 
  3.1. Stores them (them being commenter username and op email) 
  3.2. Queries client for op email in order to access: 
    3.2.1. op notification tokens 
    3.2.2. op unread notifications
3* Raises error "change params not found"

4. Double check whether comment is still available (not applicable rn, because no delete option)
4* if it's been removed, return

5. Check whether op's notification tokens have been logged properly 
5* if nothing's been stored, return

6. Create messaging.Notification object with desired title and body 

7. Create message.Messaging object with retrieved token and notification created in 6

8. messaging.send(msg), where msg is the object we created in 7

--- 
Possible issues:
- Not all tokens have the notification sent to (currently it's only set to the first element in the list)
- Optional binding equivalent in Python???
