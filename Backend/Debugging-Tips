Error: 
raise ImportError(
ImportError: The requests library is not installed from please install the requests package to use the requests transport.

What I tried:
- ALWYAYS REMEMBER TO ACTIVATE VENV WHEN DEPLOYING CLOUD FUNCTIONS!!! Otherwise you'll get a bunch of ImportError
- python -m pip install requests ---- didnt work even with venv activated 
- Alternatively, tried uninstalling the package and reinstalling it with sudo -H pip3 install requests, got the same error
- import requests did NOT help either
- Ended up wiping the whole codebase and starting over :D
