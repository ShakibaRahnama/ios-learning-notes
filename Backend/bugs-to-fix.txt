1. Loading pinwheel on calendar view 
2. The cloud function for sending notifications is buggy (raises KeyError for event paramteres, so I 
think what's wrong is that I haven't double checked variable names -- I already have the function flow
down)
3. The logic for my discover view in SwiftUI is also buggy (I assumed if I load op information and store
it in a different list it will work the same, but what I'm seeing now is that they're not necessarily 
compatible, so try a different logic)
4. SwiftUI view for the sign up is buggy (I got it off ChatGPT but I added a textfield so it doesn't look 
good when it's scrolled)
