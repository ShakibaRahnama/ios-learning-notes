1. Add the Custom Font to Your Project:

Drag and drop your custom font file (e.g., CustomFont.ttf) into your Xcode project.
Make sure the font file is included in the "Copy Bundle Resources" build phase.
Update Info.plist:

2. Open Info.plist.
Add a new entry with the key Fonts provided by application.
Set the value to the filename of your font (e.g., CustomFont.ttf).

3. Use the Custom Font in SwiftUI:
                Text("MyApp")
                    .font(.custom("CustomFontName", size: 34))
                    .fontWeight(.bold)
                    .padding(.bottom, 40)


Info.plist might initially not show up in the project directory. Something you can do is tweak something in the Target > Info and then it'll show up.
