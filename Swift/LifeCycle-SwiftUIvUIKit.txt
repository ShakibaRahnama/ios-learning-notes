SwiftUI App Life Cycle
In a SwiftUI-based app, the life cycle is managed by the @main attribute and conforms to the App protocol. Here are the key components:

Application Launch:

@main and App Protocol: The entry point of the app is defined using the @main attribute on a struct that conforms to the App protocol. This struct defines the main scene of the app.
Scene Management:

Scene: The main scene is defined using a WindowGroup, which provides the initial view hierarchy.
State Management:

State management is more declarative and integrated with the SwiftUI view hierarchy using properties like @State, @Binding, @ObservedObject, @StateObject, and @EnvironmentObject.
Application Life Cycle Modifiers:

You can handle life cycle events using scene phase modifiers such as onChange(of:).

UIKit App Life Cycle
In a UIKit-based app, the app life cycle is managed by the UIApplicationDelegate protocol. Here are the key methods and their roles:

Application Launch:

application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:): Called when the app has finished launching and is ready to run. This is where you typically set up your initial view controller and other necessary configurations.
State Transitions:

applicationDidBecomeActive(_:): Called when the app becomes active (foreground).
applicationWillResignActive(_:): Called when the app is about to become inactive (e.g., incoming phone call).
applicationDidEnterBackground(_:): Called when the app enters the background.
applicationWillEnterForeground(_:): Called when the app is about to enter the foreground from the background.
applicationWillTerminate(_:): Called when the app is about to terminate. This is the place to save data if needed.
Handling Background Tasks:

application(_:performFetchWithCompletionHandler:): Used for background fetch.
application(_:handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession:completionHandler:): Used for handling background URL session events.
Handling Notifications:

application(_:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:): Called when a remote notification is received.
application(_:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:): Called when the app successfully registers for remote notifications.

Key Differences
Entry Point:

UIKit: Uses @UIApplicationMain or manually sets up UIApplicationDelegate.
SwiftUI: Uses @main attribute on a struct conforming to App.
Life Cycle Management:

UIKit: Life cycle methods are handled in UIApplicationDelegate.
SwiftUI: Life cycle events are managed using scene phases and environment values.
View Hierarchy:

UIKit: Views are managed with view controllers.
SwiftUI: Views are declaratively defined using structs.
State Management:

UIKit: State is managed through various means, including properties and notification centers.
SwiftUI: State is managed declaratively using property wrappers like @State and @ObservedObject.
