// The process takes place in 5 steps: 
// 1. Set up a server
// 2. User registration and device tokens
// 3. Define specific events
// 4. Implement event detection 
// 5. Send push notifications 
// 6. Handle notifications in the app

// If using FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging), it boils down to:
// Integrating Firebase into the app, generating tokens, etc. (explained in detail in ios-learning-notes/Swift/Notifications)
// Set up Firebase Cloud Functions to trigger notifications based on specific events. 
// When a relevant event occurs, such as a new message or event trigger, your server can use Firebase Cloud Functions 
// (as shown in the example above) or the Firebase Admin SDK to send a push notification to the user's device.

// I'll write down the steps to use Firebase Cloud Functions more extensively in a different file
