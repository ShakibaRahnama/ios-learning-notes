@StateObject >>> creates an observable object, manages the object's life cycle (will deallocate the observable object when the instance of the view is destroyed), 
persists data across updates. Currently using it for Scintilla's discover view, but the fact that it refreshes everytime the user navigates back and forth to the 
view gives a clunky experience. A possible solution is persisting the data in a local container unless user refreshes.
